# SpiderShowdown
VR game

The action is happening into the woods and your mission is
to kill spiders, as many as possible. Your weapon is shooting with balls, 
when you hit a spider with a ball, he will die. For shooting is a 
cooldown for 2 seconds. You have a health and when is 0 ... well that means 
you are dead. The health decreases when a spider is attacking and increases
when you are safe (not a single spider is attacking).

Controls:
* B -> start game and after shooting
* joystick -> move
* A -> jump and after you die reset the game

P.S. the .apk file is in Spider Showdown folder. :)
